Right now I envision three major sections:
* A section for the Blabcasts
* A section for my courses
* An about page

I think these three sections will comprise the primary menu.

I need an email opt-in block.

I think I will put links for the primary sections, contact and email opt-in in a secondary menu.

So I need a tertiary menu for legal stuff like privacy policy and terms of service?

I think that the Home page needs to be the full node view of the latest Blabcast. I want to give visitors what they came for as soon as they hit the site. Don't make me think!
