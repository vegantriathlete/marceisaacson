This directory holds the script for the lecture. If you are using version control, then you will likely have just one file in this directory. If you choose to not use version control (oh, the horror!), then you can place the different versions of your script in this directory. But, seriously, you really should learn to use version control. You are using to some extent right now by copying this repository, aren't you?

I prefer to write my scripts out word-for-word for a number of reasons.
* I plan to translate my courses into multiple languages
* I close caption all my courses and I need the transcript anyway
* I find that I'm able to do a better job with delivery

You will have to decide whether that works for you.

I have been undertaking the time consuming task of turning my scripts into teleprompters by using slideshow presentation software. I'm going to give some [free online software](http://www.easyprompter.com/) a shot to see how that works.
