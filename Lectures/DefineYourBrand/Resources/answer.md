I want the site to instill trust and confidence.
I want it to be a very soft sell.
I want it to be a what you see is what you get, no hidden agenda experience.

So, I'm thinking I want a pretty simple color scheme, leaning towards pretty much black and white. I'll see what a minimalist theme looks like. I want to keep things really clean and highly legible.

I think I want to use all Sans Serif fonts even for headlines.
I will use minimally stylized elements.
I think I will test a plain white background.

I'll use a two-column layout: Content area on the left and side bar on the right.
