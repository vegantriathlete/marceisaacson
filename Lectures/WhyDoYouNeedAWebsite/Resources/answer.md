# What is my website supposed to accomplish for me?
This website is being built initially to serve two purposes:
* Market my Udemy courses
* Build an email list

Later on I think I want to add Affiliate Marketing of Udemy courses.
I will use my affiliate links to the courses of instructors I interview for the Udemy Weekly Inspiration for Success Blabcasts

Further down the road I may also want to use the site to establish me as an authority and to market other products or services (such as coaching).
